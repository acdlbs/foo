[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to switch from using Cryogen to generate my static site to Hugo. I originally chose Cryogen as it was a static site generator that used Clojure and would allow for me to further my knowledge of the language \u0026ndash; however after using the framework I found that due to its lack of support It would be smoother for me to switch to a more popular static site generator. Hugo seemed like the obvious choice due to the many blogs I\u0026rsquo;ve seen implemented in it. The paper mod theme also was a compelling attribute.\n","permalink":"https://acdlbs.github.io/post/in-which-cryogen-was-switched-to-hugo/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to switch from using Cryogen to generate my static site to Hugo.

I\u0026rsquo;m a graduating senior at the University of Florida studying computer science. My biggest interests in the tech sphere are: GPU-accelerated computing, networks, sysadmin, functional programming and lisps.\nMy time at the University of Florida At UF, I have been active as the project manager of the VR Club. Through this role I’ve learned valuable skills in regards to working in groups, reducing scope creep and C# development. Here, I have helped work on a Boids simulation involving parallel GPU computing and Cuda programming. I have also taken courses in Data Structures/Algorithms, Operating Systems, Information Systems \u0026amp; Databases, Design Patterns, and Linear Algebra/Numerical Analysis.\nProfessional experience I have interned as a Junior Software Engineer at Saga-IT. This opportunity allowed me to become more familiar with a variety of tools and software - from asp.net development, employing Web Accessibility Testing Tools in CI workflows, to developing a solution cache busting approach used on the Saga website.\nOutlook What I love about software development is that it never becomes mundane. With an ever changing tech stack, solutions always require learning. I think that the most important skill I’ve learned during my time as a developer is the ability to know how to learn efficiently and effectively.\n","permalink":"https://acdlbs.github.io/about/","summary":"Hey - I\u0026rsquo;m Aiden!
